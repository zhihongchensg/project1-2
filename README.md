# project1-2
project 1, 2nd game

This is a basic interaction / NLP game
Board of 16, array of 8 pokemons
Each pokemon has a set of values/parameters (name, type, favourite, stage)
Each pokemon will be displayed twice on the Board
Every time the game starts, the Board is randomised to display 16 pokemons
On start, the Board is blanked out. 
The player can just type in any question/sentences, whatever he is looking for
The programme will read the player input, search.
If the relevant pokemon is found, then it will display the pokemon on the board
To search again, just backspace or delete the input
